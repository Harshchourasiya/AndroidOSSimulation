# Android Apps Recent Simulation
This is a simple project with purpose to imporve the understanding of MultipleThreading. In this project I created 3 most common apps like Clock, Timer and Stopwatch and create a home screen with apps. User can open any app, go back and open other apps. App State remains the same (like Timer and Stopwatch counting time) until User don't clear the apps recent as you can see on the Image.
